Day 1 :
	a. Spent time on looking for a good topic to work upon
Day 2 :
	a. Finalized Song Recommendation to be the topic and started looking for datasets
Day 3 : 
	a. Finalized a dataset containing 120k popular songs from 1921 to 2020.
	b. Thought about the algorithms that could be of use in the project.
Day 4 :
	a. Did EDA on the dataset
	b. Started learning Tkinter for GUI implementation
Day 5 (MON):
	a. Used KMeans as an algorithm to get clusters for recommendation based on 'classes'
	b. Used Elbow method to find best parameters for KMeans
	c. First prototype of gui built which accepted the data and sampled in the classes.
Day 6 (TUE):
	a. Researched on best and efficient algorithm to get dataset closest to a particular entry
	b. Found KDMeans to be the useful one and added that on the project
	c. Worked on gui to include KDMeans to give 3 recommendations from each 'class'
Day 7 (WED: review1 day):
	a. Worked on betterment of gui design/interface
Day 8 (THU):
	a. Worked on Error handling in the gui part.
	b. More gui improvements
	c. Researched on user age vs song likeability over Internet.
	d. Found  an intersting article via Deezer which stated that people mostly stop listening to new music by age of 30
	e. Added another window to get user name and age.
	f. Gave initial choices to user in gui on the basis of the song within age as (Date of Birth + 30) to Date of Birth.
Week last:
        a. Added button to show User's listen history
	b. Added Hindi language dataset (containing around 500 songs) from spotify api
	c. Improved code to detect hindi dataset and thus, give the other labels.
	d. Analysed and added labels for Hindi songs
